The purpose of this plugin is to enforce the use of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in a Gradle-based project.

## Setup
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("it.nicolasfarabegoli.conventional-commits") version "<last-version>"
}
```

Simply applying the plugin as above, a pre-configured script for conventional commit check is generate.

The plugin creates a git hooks file that enforce that each commit is compliant with the Conventional Commit convention:

```bash
> git commit -m "some message"
The commit message does not meet the Conventional Commit standard
An example of a valid message is:
  feat(login): add the 'remember me' button
More details at: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary

> git commit -m "feat: we love conventional commit!"
Commit message meets Conventional Commit standards...
```

All the available plugin's keys are shown below:

```kotlin
conventionalCommits {
    warningIfNoGitRoot = true
    
    types += listOf("types", "type2") // Add those types to the standard ones
    
    scopes = emptyList()
    
    successMessage = "Commit message meets Conventional Commit standards..."
    
    failureMessage = "The commit message does not meet the Conventional Commit standard"
}
```
