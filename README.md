## Usage
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("it.nicolasfarabegoli.conventional-commits") version "<last-version>"
}
```

### Configuration

By default, no configuration is needed and a default script is generated.  
For custom script, you could use mainly two method:

Provide the script directly:

```kotlin
conventionalCommits {
    from {
        "echo 'hello world'"
    }
    setupScript() //this is needed (at the very bottom) because of gradle :(
}
```

Or give a URL pointing to a script:

```kotlin
conventionalCommits {
    from(URL("https://example.com/commit-msg.sh"))
    
    setupScript() //this is needed (at the very bottom) because of gradle :(
}
```

By default the first argument of the method `from` use the following shebang line: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
That shebang line could be overwrite passing the desired one, for example:

```kotlin
conventionalCommits {
    from("#!/bin/zsh") {
        "echo 'hello world'"
    }
    
    setupScript()
}
```
the previous configuration produce the following script:

```shell
#!/bin/zsh

echo 'hello world'
```
